The code is based off the "Beat the Benchmark" and "Fork me" Notebooks

We achieved 95.04% accuracy

We  added:
- label smoothing ( works)
- mixup ( works )
- warm upfor 1 epoch and the cool down for 4 ( this was ultimately commented out, as it had a bug I could not resolve it in time , you can see the commented code )
